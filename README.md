# SF-Crime-Statistics-with-Spark-Streaming
In this project, we provide a statistical analyses of the data using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. We created a Kafka server to produce data, a test Kafka Consumer to consume data and ingest data through Spark Structured Streaming. Then we applied Spark Streaming windowing and filtering to aggregate the data and extract count on hourly basis.
